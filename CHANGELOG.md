## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-10

### Added
- **Bytecode Analysis Module** (`src/analysis/bytecode.ts`)
  - Comprehensive bytecode retrieval system with `fetchBytecode()` function
  - Zod validation for Ethereum addresses and bytecode format
  - LRU caching layer using `lru-cache` (10-minute TTL, 1000 entry limit)
  - Safe error wrapping via `safeAsync` utility
  - Support for ethers v6 JsonRpcProvider
- **Bytecode Analysis Features**
  - `preloadBytecode()` for efficient batch operations
  - `isContract()` to distinguish contracts from EOA addresses
  - `getBytecodeSize()` for calculating bytecode size in bytes
  - `isProxyContract()` to detect common proxy patterns (EIP-1167, etc.)
  - Cache management functions (`clearBytecodeCache()`, `getCacheStats()`)
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**
  - 33 unit tests covering all bytecode functionality
  - Mocked ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider for isolated testing
  - Error handling tests for network, rate limit, and timeout scenarios
  - Edge case coverage including null responses and malformed data
- **Dependencies**
  - Added `ethers` v6.15.0 for Ethereum provider interactions
  - Added `lru-cache` v11.1.0 for efficient in-memory caching
